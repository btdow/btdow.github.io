I'm a graduate student at Cleveland State University studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm currently working as a programming tutor, and researching GPGPU acceleration in computational commutative algebra and hardware security.

In my free time, I play bass in a hardcore band, keyboards for a rock band, guitar for a shoegazey project, and make noises with my little Eurorack.
